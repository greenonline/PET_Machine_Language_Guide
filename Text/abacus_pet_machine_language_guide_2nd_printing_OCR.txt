INTRODUCTION

     For those of you who are not satisfied with programming
only in the BASIC language, for those of you who cannot make
BASIC run fast enough for your applications, for those of
you who are curious about the inner workings of your PET, or
for those of you who just want to buy another manual, this
guide is dedicated.

     The information contained in this guide was not readily
available from a single source when writing began on it.

     I have had to hunt, scrape, rummage, and experiment for most
of it. The on-off switch on my PET is nearly worn out from
use, having had to power it off and back on after crashing
the operating system countless times.

     This manuscript is entitled the "PET Machine Language
Guide". You are probably familiar with the low level lan-
guages or the title would not have attracted your attention.
This guide is not intended to be a tutorial on programming
in machine language. It is intended to be a reference for
the machine language programmer who wants to use the builtin
features of the PET. There is no use in "reinventing the
wheel” if you can use the wheels already supplied with your
PET, referring of course to the builtin ROM routines. Many
programmers are commanding more than $15 per hour for their
services. If this guide saves you an hour's time by showing
you new or improved ways to program, then I'd like to think
that the guide has more than paid for itself.

     The routines used in this guide are relatively simple.
The routines use a very small portion of the 6502 instruction
set. The beginning machine language programmer should have
little trouble learning the instructions that are used here.
The beginner should stick to simple and straight-foward
routines at first. Save the fancy instructions and addressing
modes for a later time. Loads and stores, compares and branches,
and the routines outlined here will take the beginner a long way
towards understanding machine language programming.

     The routines presented here will run on either the 4K/8K
Pets with the older operating system or the 16K/32K Pets with
the newer revised operating system. Throughout this guide the
text will reference memory locations that apply to the 4K/8K
Pets. The corresponding memory locations for the 16K/32K Pets


                           1


will appear in parenthesis.

     Although many machine language monitors are currently
available for the PET, I have chosen to use the Commodore
version because it is either supplied on tape to all owners
of the 4K/8K PETS or it is built into ROM for owners of the
16K/32K PETS. The monitors do a nice job of allowing me to
quickly enter machine language routines into the PET's
memory .

     I would like to express my thanks to Jim Russo of Ann
Arbor, Michigan who provided me with some of the updated
information about the newer 16K/32K PETS. His efforts saved
me much time in revising this guide.

     For those of you with criticism, comments, corrections,
questions, or praise, I would be glad to hear from you. I
am hoping that you feel that you are getting your money's
worth from this guide. With the prices of books and manuals
as high as they are these days, ABACUS SOFTWARE is trying to
provide you with practical and useful information at a
reasonable price.

                                     THANK YOU.

               MACHINE LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING

     Shortly after the PET was born, it learned to speak
in a machine language dialect called 6502ese. Commodore
later on, taught the PET to speak a foreign language,
BASIC. Now the PET uses BASIC to talk to you because
it realizes that most of you are well-versed in the BASIC
language.

     Since PET learned to speak 6502ese first, it prefers
to think in its native language. If you speak to it in
BASIC, the PET will require a little extra time to translate
the BASIC into 6502ese, but it will understand you. The
PET is no different from those of you who are bilingual.
You may speak more than one language, but all of your
thought processes are carried out in your native language.

     Now BASIC is not your native language, but it more
closely resembles your native language than does 6502ese.
So if I talk to you in 6502ese, it will probably take you
a little time to translate the ideas into terms that you
can understand.

     A machine language program is a series of binary
instructions that directs the microprocessor to carry
out very elementary tasks. The instructions perform very
primitive functions - reading and writing, adding and
subtracting, shifting and rotating, anding and oring -
functions that involve a single memory location.

     Machine language programming involves considerable
effort when routines of any sizeable length are to be
written. The programmer must keep account of the memory
locations that the instructions reference. He must insert
the representation of those locations into the series of
instructions. If the programmer later on decides to insert
additional instructions into the program, then he may very
well have to change several of the previously calculated
memory locations. Programming in machine language becomes
very tedious and error-prone.

     Assembly language programming is a step up from
machine language programming. Machine instructions are
defined mnemonically. Memory locations are symbolically
referenced. An assembler program processes the assembly
language statements, converts the mnemonics into their


                           3


machine language equivalents and converts the symbolic
references to memory locations into their appropriate
binary equivalents. Programming in assembler language
is much less error-prone than in machine language but
remains a tedious job.

     Machine language and assembler language programs
operate on very primitive data elements. High level
languages such as BASIC are designed to operate on more
sophisticated data structures. Programming in high
level languages relieves the programmer of much of the
tedious work associated with the lower level languages.
Programs can be written in less time and are less error-
prone. You must pay a price for the advantages which
a high level language provides. The price is an increase
in the amount of memory used and an increase in run time.
Remember that the PET has to translate the foreign language
BASIC into 6502ese before it can understand what you want
it to do for you. BASIC therefore runs slower than pure
machine language instructions.

     Now that I've convinced you that machine language
programs will run circles around BASIC programs, I will
lead you through the steps of building a machine language
program.

     Firstly you must have a clear understanding of just
what it is that your program is to accomplish. You must
decide upon an approach to take in building that program.
Unfortunately this step is often given too little thought.
The programmer is too anxious to get into the programming
step that the program suffers. The author hasn't clearly
thought out the method. This step is vital regardless of
the programming language used. It must be addressed for
a program written in BASIC as well as machine or assembly
language.

     For example, I decide that I need to compute the
logarithm (in base 10) of various arguments. I could
approach this program in several ways: a) creating a
table of the logarithms and looking them up as needed;
b) finding the logarithm from scratch by using a complex
series of formulas; c) using a derivative of a built-in
function. By using the PET's built-in function I can
create a very simple program. This eliminates the need
for a complex program thereby simplifying the overall
task to be done, namely to compute the common logarithm
for a given argument.


                           4


     Secondly you have to decide where in memory you will
place the machine language program. Most machine language
programs will run alongside a BASIC program. SO you must
make sure that the machine language program is protected
from destruction by BASIC or the operating system. The
article following this one will cover this in detail. For
most machine language programs you can use the PET's
second cassette buffer (memory locations 826 to 1017).

     Thirdly you have to write the program itself. Without
the aid of an assembler program, you will have to hand-
assemble the assembler language source. I'll leave it to
you to find a way of generating the resultant machine
language code. I'd advise you to keep your routines as
short as possible if you must resort to hand-assembly
techniques. Also take advantage of the routines that
are described in this manual. They will save you much
time and effort. The bibliography at the end of this
manual lists several sources for assembler programs for
the PET.

     Forthly you have to decide how you will put the
resultant machine language program into memory. You can
poke the program into memory from a BASIC program. An
alternative way is to use a machine language monitor
This is by far the superior alternative. By using the
monitor you can also alter and display memory, and you can
save and reload your programs on cassette. Of course the
assembler programs will probably assemble code directly
into PET's memory.

     Lastly you have to decide how you will test your new
programs. It isn't too often that I write a program which
runs correctly the first time that I try it. Once again
the machine language monitor offers some help in testing
these programs. By inserting special instructions into
the program to be tested, you can cause the program to
temporarily halt execution. At this time you can examine
the contents of memory and registers and alter them if you
desire. Then you can continue execution of the program
from this breakpoint. If you don't use a monitor, then
you will have to test blindly. A single bad instruction
in the program could hang up the PET forcing you to turn
it off and back on to recover from the error.


                           5


           PROTECTION OF MACHINE LANGUAGE ROUTINES




     When the PET is turned on, or the reset function is
called, the operating system initializes PET's memory for
BASIC. It sets up its work areas, constants, and pointers
50 as to maximize the number of BASIC statements which will
fit into the limited amount of available memory.

     No problems arise with this method of initialization
unless you want to use a machine language routine. The
problem is: "where in memory should the routine be placed
so that BASIC does not destory the routine?". Commodore
recommends that you use the cassette buffer for the second
tape drive. This provides you with 192 memory locations
into which you can place your routine.

     But what if the routine is larger than 192 memory
locations ? Or what if the second cassette buffer is being
used? The easiest way to insure that the machine language
routine will not be destroyed is by making BASIC think that
the amount of memory available to it is somewhat smaller
than the actual amount of memory in the PET.

     On reset, the operating system determines the actual
amount of memory available. The operating system does this
by writing a specific character to a single memory location,
and then rereading this same location. If the character
read is the same as the character written, then that memory
location really exists. This same procedure is then applied
to successively higher memory locations. When the character
read is not the same as the character written, then it is
determined that the previous write and read was to the
highest available memory location. This location is then
placed in the pointer at $86-87 ($34-35 for 16K/32K PETS).
BASIC uses this pointer to determine how much working area
it can use for itself.

     If you alter this pointer before BASIC begins storing
statements, variables, etc., then you can protect a
machine language routine from destruction by BASIC. For
an 8K PET, this pointer normally contains $00 20 (least
significant byte, most significant byte). If you change
the pointer to $00 1C, you will protect the 1024 memory
locations from $1C00 to $2000. You have in effect made
BASIC unaware of the existance of those memory locations.
The most straight-foward way to chane the pointer is to
POKE the pointer with the altered values. Locations


                           6


$85-86 ($34-35 in 16K/32K PETS) correspond to 134-135
(52-53 in 16K/32K PETS) for POKE statements. Thus to
protect a machine language routine which begins at $1C00
you would do the following:

    (For 8K PET only)


          POKE 134,0            LSB=$00=0
          POKE 135,28           MSB=$1C=28

     The following table illustrates the protection
method for the various models of the PET.

        HIGHEST MEMORY  VALUE TO POKE TO          PROTECTED
MODEL      LOCATION    PROTECT 1023 MEM. LOC.     LOCATIONS


 4K          $1000           $0C00   POKE 134,0   $0C00-1000
                                     POKE 135,12

 8K          $2000           $1C00   POKE 134,0   $1C00-2000
                                     POKE 135,28

16K          $4000           $3C00   POKE 52,0    $3C00-4000
                                     POKE 53,60

32K          $8000           $7C00   POKE 52,0    $7C00-8000
                                     POKE 53,124

     These statements should be executed in direct mode
before any BASIC statements are stored. With the pointer
altered, BASIC is not aware that memory locations greater
than $1C00 for the 8K PET. A machine language program can
be placed anywhere between $1C00 and $2000 and be free from
destruction by BASIC.


                           7


                    CLOCKS AND TIMERS




     Every computer has at least one clock which paces
the execution of its instructions. The PET user has access
to several of these clocks. You are free to use the clocks
for whatever purpose you desire providing that you under-
stand the method of operation. The following lists several
of these clocks:

   4K/8K  16K/32K
1) $0200   $008D   increments every 1092.1667 seconds
2) $0201   $008E   increments every    4.2667 seconds
3) $0202   $008F   increments every 1/60th of a second
4) SE848   $EB48   decrements every microsecond(.000001 second)
5) SEB49   SE849   decrements every 256 microseconds.

     The clocks at memory locations $0200-0202 ($008D-008F
for 16K/32K PETS) work together to form the "jiffie" clock.
The register at $0202 ($008F in 16K/32K PETS) increments
every 1/60th of a second. It counts upward from 0 to 255.
When it rolls over from 255 to 0, it causes the register
at $0201 ($008E in 16K/32K PETS) to be incremented by one.
Similarly, the register at $0201 ($008E in 16K/32K PETS)
counts from 0 to 255, and when it rolls over to 0, it
causes the register at $0200 ($008D in 16K/32K PETS) to
be incremented by one.

     Thus the register at $0201 ($008E in 16K/32K PETS)
increments every 1/60 * 256 = 4.2667 seconds and the
register at $0200 ($008D in 16K/32K PETS) increments every
1/60 * 256 * 256 = 1092.1667 seconds.

     When the BASIC user accesses TI, the jiffie clock, he
is actually accessing the three contiguous memory locations
starting at $0200 ($008D for 16K/32K PETS). The BASIC
statement T = TI assigns to the variable "T", the value in
registers $0200-0202 ($008D-008F in 16K/32K PETS). The
built-in function converts the three byte binary value at
those locations to the floating point variable "T".

     When you, as the BASIC user access TI$, the time of
day clock, the PET software is actually converting the


                           8


jiffie clock to the time of the day. The following algo-
rithm is similar to the conversion routine that is performed
by the PET in evaluating TI$


  HH = INT(TI/(60%60%60))

  MM = INT((TI-(HH*60*60*60))/(60%60))

  SS = INT((TI-(HH*60*60*60)~(MM*60*60))/60)

     The jiffie clock begins counting when the PET is turned
on. It initially has a value of zero when first powered on.
It continues counting upwards from zero unless reset by a
BASIC assignment -  TI$="HHMMSS" which converts the
HHMMSS of TIS$ to jiffies as below:

     TI = (HH*60%60*60) + (MM*60%*60) + (SS*60)

     You may use the jiffie clock to time various functions.
Below is an example of a routine which will inform you when
ten seconds have elapsed:

   10 S=TI:                          REM  SAVE STARTING JIFFIE COUNT
   20 PRINT"START OF INTERVAL HAS BEGUN"
   30 IF TI-S<10*60 THEN 30:         REM  LOOP UNTIL 10 SECS ELAPSE
   40 PRINT"TEN SECONDS HAVE ELAPSED"

     You may also use the jiffie clock to time short intervals.
Below is an example of a routine which computes the time that
it takes you to react to a message that is displayed on the
screen. The routine will flash a message on the screen and
wait for you to depress any key.

  10 PRINT"(CLR CD CD CD)WHEN YOU SEE THE NEXT MESSAGE APPEAR
on"
  20 PRINT" (CD)THE SCREEN, DEPRESS ANY KEY AND I WILL"
  30 PRINT" (CD)MEASURE YOUR REACTION TIME."
  40 PRINT" (CD)';TAB(12);"GET READY"
  50 DELAY=TI:                      REM  START OF WAIT PERIOD
  60 IF TI-DELAY<60*3 THEN 60:      REM  WAIT A FEW SECONDS


                           9


  70 PRINT"(CLR)"
  80 DELAY=TI
  90 IF TI-DELAY<60*3 THEN 90:       REM  WAIT A FEW MORE SECONDS
  100 PRINT" (CD CD CD CD)"
  110 POKE 525,0:                    REM  IGNORE KEYS PRESSED
  120 REM POKE 158,0 for 16K/32K Pets
  130 PRINT"PRESS ANY KEY NOW"       REM  GIVE GO AHEAD SIGNAL
  140 s=r1:                          REM  START TIMING
  150 GET A$:IF A$=""THEN 150:       REM  LOOP UNTIL A KEY PRESSED
  160 P=TI:                          REM  END OF TIMING LOOP
  170 PRINT" (CD CD)YOUR REACTION TIME WAS" (P-S)/60"SECONDS"
  180 END

     The above routine is suitable for measuring intervals
which do not require more resolution than several jiffies.
A BASIC statement may require several milliseconds for
execution, so the jiffie clock cannot resolve very small
time intervals.

     When high resolution timing is required, you must
write routines at a machine language level. The register
at $EB48 counts down from 255 to 0 every microsecond. When
it reaches zero, it rolls over to 255 again and causes the
register at $E849 to count down by one. Thus every 256
microseconds, register $E849 is decremented. Technically
we call these registers timers and not clocks. The timers
are similar to the familiar "oven timer". Once set, it will
count down. When it reaches zero, the little bell will go
off. This is similar to how the PET's timers work.

     The following routine is a rough estimate of the time
that is required to count to 100 in machine language. The
routine uses the microsecond timers at SE848-E849. Keep
in mind that they count downwards from 255 to 0.

     After running the above program using the Commodore
machine language monitor the following results appeared:

                 0351  xx   3A   FD   xx   xx

              100 - AC = 100 - 3A = C6 = 19810 ----—- + 198

                                                        966 micsec.

              100 - XR = 100 - FD = 03 = 310  3 * 256 = 768

              100 - AC = 100 - 41 = BF = 19110------  + 191

                                                        959 micsec.
     The 966 microseconds (959 microseconds with 16K/32K PETS)
is an interval which could not be measured with the jiffie
clock whose resolution is only .01600 seconds.


                           11


             SCREEN DISPLAY AND CURSOR POSITIONING



     The PET uses a memory mapped video display. Char-
acters are displayed on the screen by storing the binary
coded representation into reserved memory locations.

     Each reserved memory location is associated with a
specific screen position. Ascending memory locations
are displayed on the screen from left to right, and from
top to bottom, in a pattern identical to reading a page
in a book. These memory locations begin at $8000 and
extend to $83E7. Memory location $8000 is displayed on
the screen at the upper left-hand corner while memory
location $83E7 appears at the lower right-hand corner.
These memory locations account for the 1000 display
positions on the PET's screen.

     There are two basic ways to write to the screen: by
storing characters directly into the video display memory
or by using the operating system's routines which in turn
write to the screen.

     The first method of screen display is similar to
poking memory from BASIC. One character's coded repre-
sentation is stored into a mapped memory location. The
exact location is determined by where you want the char-
acter to appear on the screen. POKE 32768,1 will cause
the letter "A" to appear at the upper left-hand corner of
the screen. Location 32768 corresponds to $8000 and '1'
is the coded representation for the letter "A".

     The screen display hardware expects the mapped memory
to contains a coded representation different from PET's
ASCII code. The screen display's coded representation
closely resembles the ASCIT code. Bit 1 of the ASCII code
is dropped. These resulting codes represent the 64 normal
printable characters. By using bit 1, an additional 64
graphic characters can be represented. This gives 128
printable characters. Finally by using bit 0, the above
128 printable characters can be reversed. This allows for
a total of 256 different printable characters.

     The following short routine will display the char-
acters that result from storing values into the mapped
memory. The values are in ascending sequence from 0 to 255
and cause a unique character to appear on the screen. Thus
poking a '0' generates a "@", 'l' generates a "A", '2'
generates a "B", etc.


                           12


   10 FOR I=0 TO 255:      REM    CODED REPRESENTATION
   20 :                    REM    .FOR VIDEO HARDWARE
   30 :                    REM    ..AND INDEX FOR SCREEN LOC.
   40 POKE 32768,T:        REM    STORE INTO MAPPED MEMORY
   50 NEXT I:              REM    REPEAT 255 TIMES
   60 END


     Of course if you prefer to do the same thing in a
machine language routine, the following will accomplish
the same goal:

ADDR   VALUE     LABEL  OPC  OPERAND    COMMENTS

033A  A2 00             LDX  #00        zero index register
033C  8A         LOOP   TXA             copy into accumulator
033D  9D 00 80          STA  $8000,X    display on screen
                 *                      .via mapped memory
0340  E8                INX             bump to next character/
                 *                      .next screen position
0341  D0 F9             BNE  LOOP       repeat 255 times
0343  00                BRK

     The second method of display involves the use of the
operating system's display routines. These routines make
use of the cursor position registers. When calling an
output to screen routine such as WRT or STROUT, the PET
will begin writing at the screen position pointed to by
the cursor position registers.

     These registers are located at $E0-E2 ($C4-C6 in
16K/32K PETS). The register pair at $E0-El ($C4-C5 in
16K/32K PETS) contains the mapped memory location (least
significant byte, most significant byte) of the screen
line at which the cursor is currently positioned. The
register at $E2 ($C6 in 16K/32K PETS) contains the number
of positions into the line at which the cursor is currently
positioned. The operating system calculates the screen
position by adding the contents of the register at $E2
($C6 in 16K/32K PETS) to $E0-El ($C4-C5 in 16K/32K PETS)
to produce the mapped memory location for the cursor
display. If the cursor were positioned at line 2, position
10 of the screen, then the cursor registers would contain:


                           13


                       REGISTERS

                    LSB   MSB    -----position within line
                   -addr of line-

     If you want to write a string at a specific location
on the screen, you would set the cursor position registers
with the appropriate values before calling the STROUT
subroutine. The example below demonstrates how you would
write the string "ABC" to the screen starting at line 11,
positon 20:

                           14


     You will note that the operating system's routines
use the PET's ASCII character representation and not the
representation required by the video display hardware.

     The following table shows the correspondence between
the mapped memory locations and the screen line numbers:

     The cursor position registers may also be used for
cursor positioning during input. Before using the
routine RDT, the operating system's input routine using
the cursor, you would set the cursor position registers
with the desired values. The flashing cursor would then
signal that the input is required, but the cursor would
be positioned at the screen position that you requested
and not at the position which the PET would have otherwise
used.

    the return key = X'0D'), then go to step 8.

5)  Store accumulator value into an input buffer. On the
    4K/8K PETS you may use memory locations $000A to $005A.
    on 16K/32K PETS you may use memory locations $0220 to
    $0250.   ($0200 - $024F)

6)  Increment the X-register.

8)  Input is now in the input buffer with the length of
    the inputted string in the x-register.

NOTE-These two routines will not run under the control of
     the machine language monitor because the monitor
     itself makes use of the X-register. You may use the
     monitor to load memory with the above programs. After
     the programs are loaded, the X command will return you
     from the monitor to BASIC. Once in BASIC you can then
     enter the command SYS(826) to begin execution of the
     above routines.


                           23


                      USR FUNCTION




     The USR function provides a technique for calling a
machine language routine from a BASIC program. The format
of the function is:

              100 B=USR(A)

                  where A is the argument to be passed
                        to the machine language routine
              and where B is the function to bhe returned
                        to the BASIC program from the
                        machine language routine.

     To use a USR function:

1) Load the machine language routine into memory by poking,
   loading from tape or using a monitor.
2) Set up the USR vector by placing the entry point of the
   machine language routine into memory locations $0001
   (LSB) and $0002(MSB) .
3) Assign a value to the variable to be passed to the
   machine language routine as the argument(A in the above
   example) .
4) Call the machine language routine using the USR function.
5) The machine language routine will compute its function
   and place it into the floating point accumulator ($BO-$B4).
6) The function value in the floating point accumulator is
   assigned to the variable on the left-hand side of the
   USR call(B in the above example).

 EXAMPLE :

     PET BASIC does not have a logarithm function for base
10. It does have a logarithm function for base e. We can
use the following equality to produce the base 10 logarithm.

          LOG10(x) = LOGe(x) * LOG10(e)

Although this is a very simple example which could very
easily be implemented entirely in BASIC, we will create
a short machine language routine which demonstrates the
USR function.


                           24



     First we must load the following machine language
routine into memory (use the machine language monitor
to insert the code beginning at memory location X'33a').

     Then we create the BASIC program:

 10 POKE 1,58:               REM   SET UP THE USR
 20 POKE 2,3:                REM   ..FUNCTION VECTOR

 50 PRINT"LOG OF";A;"IS";B:  REM   PRINT OUT ANSWER
 60 END

RUN

LOG OF 6027 IS 3.78010118
READY.

     When BASIC encounters statement 40, it evaluates the
argument A and places it into the floating point accumulator.
Next a linkage is set up so that control is passed back to
the USR function for evaluation of B after the machine
language routine completes. Finally control is passed to


                           25


the machine language routine.

     The machine language routine does the following:

1)  The argument passed from BASIC has already been placed
    into the floating point accumulator. Subroutine LOGE
    is called at $D8BF ($DBF6 for 16K/32K PETS) to compute
    the natural logarithm of this function. The result is
    left in the floating point accumulator.

2)  A pointer is set up in the A and Y registers for the
    subroutine MVAFAC which will move the value pointed
    to by the A,Y register pair into the alternate
    floating point accumulator. Subroutine MVAFAC is
    called at $D9SE ($D998 for 16K/32K PETS) thereby
    placing the constant into the alternate floating
    point accumulator.

3)  Subroutine FPMULT is called to compute the product
    of the floating point accumulator and the alternate
    floating point accumulator with the result being left
    in the former. Thus the floating point accumulator
    contains the logarithm in base 10 of the argument
    which was passed to the machine language routine .

4)  Since the product is already in the floating point
    accumulator (where BASIC expects the function to be),
    we execute a return from subroutine to go back to the
    BASIC program. B is evaluated in statement 40 by
    assigning to it the value in the floating point
    accumulator. Execution continues with the remainder
    of the BASIC program.

     In this case, when we run the program we find that
the function returned to out BASIC program is 3.78010118.
We can verify the answer by directly entering the
command :

PRINT 10^B ----which prints out a result of 6026.99979,
the difference being caused by conversion and rounding.


                           26


                  NUMBER REPRESENTATION




     PET BASIC uses two methods of representing numbers
internally. They are referred to as fixed point repre-
sentation and floating point representation. Each has
its advantages and disadvantages and will be discussed
separately. The fixed point numbers are the easier of
the two to understand and will be introduced first.


                           27


                   FIXED POINT NUMBFRS

     Fixed point numbers are often referred to as integers.
Variables of this type may assume only integer values, that
is they may not have any fractional portions. Fixed point
variables are specified by using a variable name with a 's$',
such as A% or B2%. A fixed point number is stored in two
memory locations inside the PET. Another way of putting
this is that 16 bits are recuired for each fixed point
representation. One of these bits is the sign bhit. Variables
may therefore range in value from -32768 to +32767.

     The high order bit is called the sign bit. A zero in
this position indicates a positive number, while a one in
this position indicates a negative number. The remaining
15 bits represent the magnitude of the number. Positive
numbers are represented in true binary form. Negative
numbers are represented in two's complement form.

     EXAMPLE-

     What is the fixed point representation of +1000?

               sign bit
                |<-true binary-->|
      1000  = 0000 0011 1110 1000 = X'03E8'
          10  |-------| |-------|
                  MSB      LSB

     What is the fixed point representation of -1000?

               sign bit
                |two's complement|
     -1000  = 1111 1100 0001 1000 = X'FF18'
          10  |-------| |-------|
                  MSB      LSB

     Fixed point numbers as used in PET BASIC have a 15
bit precision and would normally require only two memory
locations. However single(non-array) fixed point variahles
actually occupy five memory locations thus wasting the
remaining tree. Arrays of fixed point numbers occupy only
two memory locations for each element with no waste.


                           28


     You can save memory by using arrays of fixed point
numbers if the limited range in values is suitable for
your application. We can demonstrate the savings of
memorv between fixed and floating point numbers in two
short programs.

 10 REM  ***FIXED POINT EXAMPLE***
 20 DIM A%(100)
 30 PRINT FRE(0)
RUN

6931

 10 REM  ***FLOATING POINT EXAM***
 20 DIM AA(100)
 30 PRINT FRE(0)
RUN

6628

     In each example we merely dimensioned two arrays and
then displaved the amount of free space that remained.
The difference in free memory locations is 6931 - 6628 =
303. The savings in memory of the fixed point program
over the floating point program is the result of saving
3 memory locations for each fixed point element in the
array (100 elements + 0th element).

     Arithmetic operations using fixed point numbers are
faster than when using floating point numbers. The 6502
instructions for addition and subtraction are designed
to operate directly with numbers represented in the fixed
point format.


                           29


                 FLOATING POINT NUMBERS

     Floating point variables may assume fractional as
well as integer values. They are useful because they
may take on values with a very wide range. Floating
point variables are specified by default. If they are
not integer('%') nor string('$') then the variable is
assumed to be of the floating point type. Each floating
point number occupies five memory locations inside the
PET whether it be a single element or an array.

     The format of a floating point number is as follows:

   exponent    sign                  mantissa
                 |<------------------------------------>|
      |    |    ||   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
                ^
               assumed radix point

     The exponent occupies one memory location. The ex-
ponent is a power of two but is stored in excess 128
notation. This means that 128 has been added to the
true exponent to allow for the easier handling of nega-
tive exponents. Thus if the exponent of a number is 16,
then you would add 128 vielding 144 = X'90'. This
last value, X'90' would be stored as the floating point
exponent. Similarly if the exponent of a number is -12,
then vou would add 128 yielding 116 = X'74' which you
would store as the floating point exponent.

     The mantissa is the fractional part of the floating
point number. It is always normalized. This means that
the fraction has been adjusted and the exponent likewise
adjusted until the most significant binary digit of the
mantissa is to the right of the assumed radix point.

     Since PET BASIC always normalized the mantissa, the
leftmost bit of the fraction is always a one. This is
redundant and so the position is used for another purpose.
This bit is used as the sign bit for the number. Thus the


                           30


fraction has an "assumed" most significant bit. A
zero sign bit indicates a positive floating point
number, while a one sign bit indicates a negative
floating point number.

     The example below shows how you may derive the
representation for a floating point number.

  PROBLEM-What is the floating point representation
          for 100010?

1)  100010 .= 0000 0011 1110 10002 . = X'03E8'
         radix                   radix

2)  Shifting the radix point 10 positions to the left
    in order to normalize the fraction while raising
    the exponent by a power of 10 gives us:

             .1111 1010 0000 0000 * 2^10

3)  The number is positive so we can set the sign bit
    to zero.

             .0111 1010 0000 0000 * 2^10

4)  The exponent is 10, but in excess 128 notation the
    exponent is 10 + 128 = 138 = 100 10102

5)  Combining the exponent and mantissa we find that the
    resultant appears as follows:

     1000 1010 0111 1010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 00002

     which if restated in hexadecimal would be:

     8A 7A 00 00 00

6)  A negative value would have a sign bit of one. Thus
    -100010 would be represented as:

     1000 1010 1111 1010 0000 D000 0000 0000 0000 00002

     or in hexadecimal form:

     8A FA 00 00 00


                           31


     Of course PET BASIC carries the precision further
than the examples above have shown, but the method is
the same. As stated at the beginning of this section,
floating point variables may take on an extremely wide
range of values.

     By experimenting with BASIC you will find what
this range is for the PET.

     PRINT  2^126.99999995

      1.70141174 E+38


     PRINT 2^-127

      5.87747176 E-39

             CONVERT ASCII TO FLOATING POINT




     Through my experiments over the past few months, I
have not found a direct way to convert a number from its
ASCII representation to floating point representation.
However the following method may be used as an alternate
way to convert to floating point representation.

     The method is based upon the BASIC USR function
which is described elsewhere in this guide. The USR
function evaluates an argument, converts it to floating
point representation and places it into the floating
point accumulator before giving control to a machine
language routine. If you could examine the floating
point accumulator after the evaluation of the argument
then you would have let BASIC do the conversion for
you.

     The following BASIC program places a short machine
language routine into the second cassette buffer. This
routine moves the contents of the floating point accumu-
lator to a save area where it may later be examine by
the BASIC program. It is necessary to relocate the
contents of the floating point accumulator because upon
return to BASIC from the machine language routine its
contents will be destroyed by subsequent BASIC statement
execution.

     The machine language routine for 4K/8K PETS is
as follows:

                 FACC  EQU $00B0
033A  A2 05            LDX #5      set up to save 6 locations
033C  B5 B0      LOOP  LDA FACC,X  load FACC indexed by X
033E  9D 47 03         STA SAVE,X  save value in 'safe' place
0341  CA               DEX         decrement X-register
0342  10 F6            BPL LOOP    if positive or
0344  F0 F8            BEQ LOOP    ..or zero keep saving
0346  60               RTS         otherwise return to BASIC
0347  00 00 00    SAVE=$000000000000    save area
034A  00 00 00


                           41


     The machine language routine for 16K/32K PETS is
as follows:

                FACC  EQU $005E
033A  A2 05           LDX #5      set up to save 6 locations
033C  B5 5E     LOOP  LDA FACC,X  load FACC indexed by X-reg
033E  9D 47 03        STA SAVE,X  save value in 'safe' place
0341  CA              DEX         decrement index register
0342  10 F6           BPL LOOP    if positive
0344  F0 F8           BEQ LOOP    .or zero keep saving
0346  60              RTS         otherwise return to BASIC
0347  00 00 00  SAVE=$000000000000 save area
034A  00 00 00

routine into the second cassette buffer and then display the
converted numbers is shown below:

          CONVERT FLOATING POINT NUMBER TO ASCIT




1)  Place the floating point number into the floating point
    accumulator $B0-B4 ($5E-62 for 16K/32K PETS).

2)  Set $B1 ($5F in 16K/32K PETS) most significant bit on to
    make the number a true binary representation.

3)  Place the sign of the number into the floating point sign
    location $B5 ($63 for 16K/32K PETS). A zero in the most
    significant bit indicates a positive number while a one
    in the bit indicates a negative number.

4)  Call subroutine FLPASC at $DCAF ($DCE9 for 16K/32K PETS).

5)  ASCII representation will be found beginning at location
    $0100 and continuing until X'00' character.

* The routine MVFACC will move the FP number to the floating
  point accumulator, generate the proper sign and make the
  number true binary.
