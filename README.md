# PET_Machine_Language_Guide
Text, code and resources from the book, *PET Machine Language Guide*, by Arnie Lee, Abacus.

Two editions:

 - 1st printing
 - 2nd printing

As neither of the PDFs online have embedded text, that can be copy/pasted, *text only* versions of the manuscripts are also supplied.

Also included are the software resources (i.e. assemblers) recommended at the end of the book, namely:
